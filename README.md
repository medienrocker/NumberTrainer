First Idea: a student clicks on "Say a Random Number". 
A random number audio clip plays and in a field several numbers are shown. 
Only one of them coresponds to the spoken number.
If the student clicks the right number, its background color changes to green and a succes audioclip plays.
If the wrong number is clicked the background turns into light red and a motivating audioclip says something like "try again".

Scope:
1. realisation as local Website
2. as a moodle database activity
3. as an android (iOS) app
4. as H5P activity
